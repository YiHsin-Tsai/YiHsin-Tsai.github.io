## Research Interest
My research focuses on the exploration of Bergman kernels within the field of complex geometry. During my Master’s program, my primary goal is to apply semi-classical methods to investigate the behavior of Bergman kernels on complex manifolds and complex orbifolds, with a particular emphasis on understanding their characteristics for large values of k. Additionally, I am exploring similar concepts in CR geometry and the Szegő kernel.
